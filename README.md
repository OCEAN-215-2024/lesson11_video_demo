2) Once your forked repository is created, copy the SSH URL into your clipboard.
3) Run `git clone your_SSH_URL` in your command line to copy the repository into your own JupyterHub. 

Our JupyterHub server has trouble remembering the file permissions for our SSH keys. If you get a file permission error with your private ssh key, run the following line of code in your Terminal:

`chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
